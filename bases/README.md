# bases

this is a base converter that converts between bases 2 - 36.  it was inspired by the first day of logic design, which was a ripoff of fourth grade Base Day with eva.  it converts everything to from base x to base 10 to base y, because i can do TO decimal and FROM decimal.  it's not the most efficient for things like binary to hex but i do not care.  it's also idiotproofed, that was the hard part.  it's very much a one trick pony [like bojack].
