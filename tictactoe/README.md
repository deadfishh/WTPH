# tic tac toe

this was my first javascript thing!  i'm not too sure what's going on in that department i kinda just threw everything in there.  kinda like the battleship except it's actually not an OOP which somehow makes it worse :D

it doesn't really do anything except the boxes get clicked but if you are intelligent you can tell when someone has won.  only if you are intelligent though.
