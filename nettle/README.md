# minesweeper

i copied the javascript off of the internet for this.  i did change some parts though (read: improve) but that is how it happens sometimes.  

here's a catcher quote:

″‘Life is a game, boy. Life is a game that one plays according to the rules.‘”

‘Yes, sir. I know it is. I know it.’

Game, my ass. Some game. If you get on the side where all the hot-shots are, then it’s a game, all right—I’ll admit that. But if you get on the other side, where there aren’t any hot-shots, then what’s a game about it? Nothing. No game.”

holden is so silly he's literally a hotshot.  mr fancy pants pency prep private school.  i can hear it in lubs' voice.

adios
