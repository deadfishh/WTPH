NO BITCHES?!?!?!?

hello there.  this is the html, css, and javascript for my website.  you might be wondering, hw√¶t does html stand for! easy! it's hooga tooga mooga looga.

anyways.  the best things in here are nonogram and wordle because i actually wrote all the javascript for that.  i wrote some of the javascript for minesweeper but that's no matter.  tictactoe was written before i knew any javascript at all so it's a nightmare!

there are also some pdfs that i made in lucidcharts that are both pretty and helpful.  

if you have any suggestions for things to add make sure to let me know in the comment section below! don't forget to like and subscribe :D
