# countries

this is my guess the countries game. you just list off as many countries as you can.  it's honestly my favorite game on the internet so obviously i decided to make it myself so that i don't ever have to rely on the internet to provide me with a good name the countries game.

this is interesting.  i wonder if anyone every reads my fgithub readmes.  it's good that my real name isn't attatched to it anywhere.
