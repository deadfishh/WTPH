# minesweeper

i copied the javascript off of the internet for this.  i did change some parts though (read: improve) but that is how it happens sometimes.  

here's a catcher quote:

″‘life is a game, boy. life is a game that one plays according to the rules.‘”

‘yes, sir. i know it is. i know it.’

game, my ass. some game. if you get on the side where all the hot-shots are, then it’s a game, all right—i’ll admit that. but if you get on the other side, where there aren’t any hot-shots, then what’s a game about it? nothing. no game.”

holden is so silly he's literally a hotshot.  mr fancy pants pency prep private school.  i can hear it in lubs' voice.

adios
