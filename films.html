        this movie is probably my favorite of all time.  i just noticed how the whole "do you just come in here and quote textbooks" scene from the bar and the "i can't learn anything from you that i couldn't read in some fuckin' book" scene from the park bench are esentially the same whichi think is interesting. i really like the whole park bench scene, i could probably quote the entire thing and i think that whole monologue is so well written especially with it being the first time in the movie will shuts up.  also the monologue that chuckie gives about "if you're still here in twenty years..." is excellent and i think that chuckie is the true unsung hero of the movie, just wanting the best for will this whole time.

        i do not like this movie. it reminds me of the 20s which was a horrible time in human history because there was no alcohol and alcapone was running rampant in the streets.  it has so many good quotes though, i love it so much.  five stars.

        this movie scares me, but that is okay.  there ws a certain scene with a bagel, an i have nothing against bagels. the first time i watched it, @thereal_adubs woke me up to say 'rachel, there is a bagel' (single quotes bc js hehehh).  the second time, i was already awake. the daughter seemed a bit insane but that is how it happens sometimes. i have nothing against crazy people.

        this one was a tragedy, like all of the other movies that are listed here. i did watch it in november, but it was over a year ago.  westy showed us part of it in spanish actually.  it has the guy that played osric in hamlet which i thought was cool.  the homo-erotic undertones were defintely there but i guess that can be said for any all male boarding school in the 50s or whenever this takes place. "science, engineering, medicine, these are all noble pursiuts, but art and poetry are what we stay alive for".  i like the stem slander. i think it's deserved.

        <b><u>saving private ryan</u> &ensp; ★★☆☆☆</b>
        <br>
        this movie absolutely is awful.  it is a glamorization of war, perhaps even worse armed forces propaganda than those tom cruise movies.  no one should be forced to watch this, it's complete nonsense and i don't know how we're supposed to take private ryan sreiously when he's played by forrest gump.  everyone knows that forrest gump fought in vietnam, not world war ii.  what kind of riverdale nonsense is this.  please fix this error.

        <b><u>breakfast at tiffany's</u> &ensp; ★★★★☆</b>
        <br>
        i watched this movie because i was dating someone in a book club, and this was the first book that we had to read.  i thought that it was going to be easy, but boy, was i wrong.  i couln't get through the first ten pages!  so i went down to the local blockbuster video to rent the movie, but it was already taken.  luckily, i got the address of the person who had it, and went down to their apparment to watch the movie with him and his teenage daughter.  however, i only got through half of the movie, as they kicked me out after i spilled wine on their couch. that is why it only gets two stars.

        i love this movie, it's definetly one of my favorites.  not much really needs to be said since it's one of the most famous movies of all time, but perhaps my favorite scene for the past six years or so has been the one on the stairs.  that's a good one.

        <b><u>armageddon</u> &ensp; ★★★★☆</b>
        <br>
        i must admit, this one was a bit boring at first, but it eventually grew on me.  normally i don't like sci-fi space movies, but this one was pretty good.  i liked the fun outfits and all of the drama and the way that the music made the drama seem more dramatic.  the ending is very sad but in good movies, they usually are. i would give it 4.5 stars but unfortunately we are on an int-only system here.
