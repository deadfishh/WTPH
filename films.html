    <div class="movieTitle"><u>barbie</u> &ensp; ★★★★☆</div>
    <br>
    i've been going back and forth on the barbie movie, and i really don't think that it's worth the hype.  it feels like i'm "not like other girls" for not liking it very much.  the message seemed to be "women are people too" and i'm sure a lot of men if not most men need that message, but it's something that i already knew.  some of the storylines were really cute though, like the old lady and the middle schooler and her mom.  it seems that the antagonist was neither the patriarchy or the matriachy, but in fact power itself.  sort of like animal farm.  i guess it makes it easier to notice certain issues that we normally ignore.  the production value was insane, and margot robbie and ryan gosling killed it.  they are the real barbie and ken.

    this movie was so excellent, definetly one of the best ones i've seen in a while.  during the scene where the bomb was about to go off, i was on the edge of my seat for ten whloe minutes which must be so difficult to do as a filmmaker.  certain lines like "and now i am become death, destroyer of worlds" and "what's gonna stop the glass" went so hard.  i think it was nice that kitty ended up being smarter than the lawer at the end of the movie.  the physics was also really cool, it made me want to change my major to physics, or at least some sort of field that's still in its infancy.  the feet stomping throughought the movie was so good, it was just a few seconds each time but it was loud and made a difference.  it was also important how he kept hallucinating people with their faces peeling off.

    <div class="movieTitle"><u>inglorious basterds</u> &ensp; ★★★★☆</div>
    <br>
    i subtracted a star because it was so violent that i had to look away, and i kept getting distracted by practicing my drawing skills during all the stabbing and shooting scenes.  i thought it was nice and tragic, however.  the girl shoshana is cool and so is her boyfriend.  she was willing to die for her cause, and i don't know if i would be willing to do that for any cause, even that one.  maybe if my entire family got killed in front of me, i would change my mind.  the ending was pretty beautiful, "jewish venegance" as she put it.  it's crazy that all three plans went through (fire, shooting, and bombs) but i guess it says a lot about society that there were three different plans to kill all the nazis.  brad pitt played a good part in this movie, that man can really do anything.

    <div class="movieTitle"><u>the help</u> &ensp; ★★★★★</div>
    <br>
    first and foremost, there wasn't a single man that played a meaningful role in this movie.  no husbands or fathers were shown, with the exception of johnny and stuart.  that was nice.  second of all, it reminds me of my favorite tumblr post of all time.  it's about huck finn, but it applies here too.  "there have always been, in past times as today, a range of people in every society, some of whom were even then fighting for a more just and compassionate accord with their fellow man and some of whom let their greeds and hatreds rule them to the worst allowable excesses. the goal of classics and history education is to teach you enough context to discern between the two, not only in the past but in the present".  skeeter did this, and celia kind of did it, and hilly's mother did a little too.  i guess it's important to not give in to social pressure like skeeter's mom did.

    <div class="movieTitle"><u>juno</u> &ensp; ★★★★☆</div>
    <br>
    i watched this movie for the first time in 8th grade health class to prevent teen pregnancy (it worked).  i like juno's character, she's very likable and cool.  there were a lot of things that i didn't pick up on the first time that i watched it, but something that i did pick up on was the soundtrack.  i've liked "so nice so smart" for the past six years.  the ending was really nice, the way that she rode over to paulie's house with her skateboard and her guitar.  and all the high school track scenes were nice too.  juno's outfits are cool with the three layers of jackets and so are all the fingernails references.  it's a very 2007 movie and i'm pretty sure it got kimya dawson famous, and i can appreciate both of those things.

    <div class="movieTitle"><u>a league of their own</u> &ensp; ★★★★☆</div>
    <br>
    i like feminist-style movies like this, and <i>a league of their own</i> was no exception.  i went into it knowing that madonna played someone, but i didn't know who.  it ended up being mae.  i liked her character.  i also liked tom hanks' character, the way that he told dottie to chew gum, because "that's what all the real ball players do".  it was sort of tragic how she ended up quitting baseball to go to oregon and have ten kids, but that's always how it goes i guess.  i liked kit's character, and the whole concept of madonna playing baseball with tom hanks.

    <br>
    this was the third time i watched this movie, and i was doing other things the entire time, and i have headphones on, but i still mananged to pick up on how good it was.  we learned about chinese film styles in my global shakespeares class when watching a hong kong rendition of twelfth night, and this movie made more sense after taking this class.  it's supposed to be over-the-top dramatics apparently, like the comics that andy warhol drew.  it's a drama, comedy, and action movie all at once, which i think is pretty cool and i'm sure it can't be easy to do but they definitly did it well. the parking lot scene was nice, probably my favorite one. i even took off my headphones for this scene.  every time i watch this movie it gets better.  i didn't like it the first time, and the second time i kind of saw the merit, but this time i thought that it was pretty good and definetly worth watching a fourth time.

    <br>
    i watched this in honor of passover, and in honor of a certain operating systems professor and friend of obama who often carries around a moses-like staff and shall remained unnamed.  the cast was extremely stacked, which i didn't realize until months later.  i like musicals, so obviously i liked this movie.  i only knew two of the songs, one was sent to me and the other i sung in middle school choir.  i don't remember much about this movie except for the fact that i enjoyed watching it so much.  maybe because i already knew the story from exodus so it was easier to pay attention, but it was so good for a cartoon film, second only to mulan.  honesetly it gave a very good message, we should start incorporating lessons and messages into non-animated movies.

    not many movies can pull off being three hours long, but this one does it well.  it was another movie where leonardo dicaprio grows up poor, goes to new york city to make money in an unsavory way, gets far too into the party scene, and eventually meets his downfall.  of course, i am referring to the great gatsby.  but i liked this movie.  it's by martin scorsese, which kind of reminded me of baz luhrman because i know nothing about film and the men that film things.  it's definetly worth watching at least once.  the ending is so tragic, but it's nice that leo eventually gets what's been coming to him for the whole three hours.  the boat scene was scary, sort of like the walter mitty boat scene, but perhaps that means it's well written.  there's something about leonardo dicaprio's characters (gatsby, shutter island, titanic) and water.  it's like the big short, but less econ and more partying, drugs, and other insanity.

    <br>
    i liked this, but i subtracted a star because it's about econ and i don't really like econ that much.  but this is about as good as it gets for a movie about stocks.  it was very captivating how margot robbie, some chef, and selena gomez explained shorting bonds, bundles, and synthetic cdos, respectively.  i liked the style as well, the way that the one character talked directly to the camera, sort of meta but in a good way, and how they showed freeze frames of events that were happening every time there was a time jump.  my favorite scene was where the two brothers are exciting that they bet everything against the aa bonds, and ben says, "do you know what you just did? you just bet against the american economy.  don't fucking laugh".  he's right.  it i think that this is a really well made movie.  
    <br><br><br>
    <div class="movieTitle"><u>a beautiful mind</u> &ensp;  ★★★★☆</div>
    <br>
    this movie is part of the genre that i like to call, "movies about genius men who are psychologically troubled".  in this genre, we also have good will hunting, dead poets' society, and the social network.  it's probably my favorite genre, so i had high expectations for this movie.  watching this movie made me like math even more than i already do.  i think it's tragic that this guy john nash was schizophrenic, because i guess illnesses really don't discriminite.  it's like that meme of ben from parks and rec, where he holds up a stick man and says, "could a depressed person make THIS?", except it's john nash, holding up his nobel prize for nash equilibrium, saying, "could a psychotic person get THIS??", and the answer is, of course, yes, because psychosis can happen to anyone.

    <div class="movieTitle"><u>shakespeare in love</u> &ensp; ★★★★★</div>
    <br>
    obviously i needed to watch the movie that beat out <i>good will hunting</i> for best picture.  i was going to make a joke about how there was cross-dressing so this was derrivative of twelfth night, but seeing how the love interest's name is viola and it's a play about shakespeare, there is a slight chance that it was on purpose. there's all sorts of shakespeare references in the normal scenes, such as "words words words" in confession, and "it was the owl that shrieked", forshadowing viola's death, so i can only imagine how many references there were that i wasn't getting.  it's a parallel of romeo and juliet, but i think it's also like romeo and juliet in the way that they aren't in love, just thirsty for bitches. i was sure that romeo got killed for real by the apothecary but i guess not!! queen elizabeth is a real one, "i know something of a woman in a man's profession".

    <div class="movieTitle"><u>mulan</u> &ensp; ★★★★★</div>
    <br>
    this is excellent.  it's a tragedy that i didn't watch this movie until i was in eighth grade music class with ms. c.  some people say that and saving private ryan are the only movies that don't make light of war.  the sound track is so good, there's only four songs which is the fewest out of any disney princess movie, but they are good songs that are necessary to the plot.  'i'll make a man out of you' is, without exageration, probably one of the most inspriational pieces of media to exist.  it did wonders for fourteen year old me who was the worst person on cross country.  mulan does not pass the bedchel test, which completely undermines the validity of that test because mulan is extremely feminist.  
    <br><br><br>
    <div class="movieTitle"><u>forrest gump</u> &ensp; ★★★★★</div>
    <br>
    out of the two hours and twenty three minutes that this movie lasted, there was not one minute that was not extremely captivating.  it may be basic, but besides good will hunting, i consider it my other favorite movie of all time (i think that the two of them are opposites).  it's quite the tragedy that in the end, bubba, jenny, and forrest's mom were all dead.  but it's nice that even though he was stupid, forrest gump still did excellent things.  i think that jenny and forrest were both floating through life all accidental-like on a breeze and it turned out very well for forrest, and very badly for jenny.  sometimes there just aren't enough rocks.  and that's all i've got to say about that.

    <div class="movieTitle"><u>in the heights</u> &ensp; ★★★☆☆</div>
    <br>
    i was obsessed with this musical in 2019, so when the movie came out in 2021, i was obviously thrilled.  however, after having watched it for the second time on the airpline on the way back from california, it's not all that.  the main characters seem to have no underlying motivations and things just happen to them.  it seems too shiny and cgi to be about growing up poor in new york city, perhaps that effect should be reserved for the gatsbys of the world.  i also don't like how they changed a lot of the parts from the broadway musical.  why does nina's mom have to be dead? what purpose does that serve? however, i think that nina and vanessa are the two baddest bitches that anyone could be and i aspire to be like both of them.  they definitely pass the bechdel test.

        <br>
        this was extremely good, and there's a lot that i could say.  the songs were good, and the characters were likable to the point that it was actually kind of tragic when they died (or got sick in mimi's case).  i'm sure that it had some sort of cultural impact, with it being about aids in new york, something that was not far away in 2005 when rent was released.  i like the whole avant garde performance art protest thing that maureen does, that was fun, cyberland is cool.  i also like how it takes place over the course of a whole year.  any time that a movie does that, it reminds me of to kill a mockingbirg, where scout is standing on the steps of boo radley's house reflecting on the past year.

        <div class="movieTitle"><u>the sound of music</u> &ensp; ★★★★★</div>
        <br>
        i've watched this movie about 50 times, but i think that about 80% of those times where when i was under the age of ten and couldn't stay awake until the end.  so i've only seen the ending a few times.  it's so long that i space out for some parts when i watch it, but this is nice because i notice something new every time.  this time, i noticed that captain vonn trapp called maria 'captain' on accident.  i also thought that rolf didn't give away their location at the end, he just shined the flashlight and saw liesel and walked away without saying anything.  perhaps that was true in the play version that i saw with my family, but in the movie, that's not how it happened.  he ended up getting scared of captain vonn trapp after he took the gun and running to tell the guards where the family was hiding.

        <br>
        this doesn't fit my theme of non-bedchel movies, but it's one of my all-time favorites.  probably one of the most defining movies for third-wave feminism, all the ideas in it hold true to today.  all men should watch this movie but unfortunely none of them will because it's got the word 'blonde' in the title and she's wearing a pink dress on the front.  adam ran upstairs because it is a girl movie.  it's excellent how she can be both a laywer and a dumb blonde, all the other lawyers were not capable of this.  as eva said about something completely unrelated, it's <i>more</i> impressive to do both.  elle woods is a good role model for small children, i am glad i watched this when i was in elementary school.

        <div class="movieTitle"><u>the social network</u> &ensp; ★★★★☆</div>
        <br>
        i watched this movie because it's ashwin's favorite, and honestly i don't think i understood it or appriciated it as much as he did.  in fact, he said that "if zuckerberg had kept facebook as he originally intended (like an exclusive online final club) it would have never taken off the way it did but he would not have had to testify before congress that he did not sell millions of people's data to advertisers".  but this is my review, not his, and i think it's hard to tell if zuck is the protagonist or the antagonist and i constatly found myself being confused on who to root for.  he wanted to distinguish himself in a population of people who all got 1600s on their SATs, and he did, so who's to say he did it the wrong way?  he did what he had to do.

        <div class="movieTitle"><u>good will hunting</u> &ensp; ★★★★★</div>
        <br>
        this movie is probably my favorite of all time.  i just noticed how the whole "do you just come in here and quote textbooks" scene from the bar and the "i can't learn anything from you that i couldn't read in some fuckin' book" scene from the park bench are esentially the same which i think is interesting. i really like the whole park bench scene, i could probably quote the entire thing and i think that whole monologue is so well written especially with it being the first time in the movie will shuts up.  also the monologue that chuckie gives about "if you're still here in twenty years..." is excellent and i think that chuckie is the true unsung hero of the movie, just wanting the best for will this whole time.
