        <b><u>legally blonde</u> &ensp; ★★★★★</b>
        <br>
        this doesn't fit my theme of non-bedchel movies, but it's one of my all-time favorites.  probably one of the most defining movies for third-wave feminism, all the ideas in it hold true to today.  all men should watch this movie but unfortunely none of them will because it's got the word 'blonde' in the title and she's wearing a pink dress on the front.  adam ran upstairs because it is a girl movie.  it's excellent how she can be both a laywer and a dumb blonde, all the other lawyers were not capable of this.  as eva said about something completely unrelated, it's <i>more</i> impressive to do both.  elle woods is a good role model for small children, i am glad i watched this when i was in elementary school.

        <b><u>the social network</u> &ensp; ★★★★☆</b>
        <br>
        i watched this movie because it's ashwin's favorite, and honestly i don't think i understood it or appriciated it as much as he did.  in fact, he said that "if zuckerberg had kept facebook as he originally intended (like an exclusive online final club) it would have never taken off the way it did but he would not have had to testify before congress that he did not sell millions of people's data to advertisers".  but this is my review, not his, and i think it's hard to tell if zuck is the protagonist or the antagonist and i constatly found myself being confused on who to root for.  he wanted to distinguish himself in a population of people who all got 1600s on their SATs, and he did, so who's to say he did it the wrong way?  he did what he had to do.

        <b><u>good will hunting</u> &ensp; ★★★★★</b>
        <br>
        this movie is probably my favorite of all time.  i just noticed how the whole "do you just come in here and quote textbooks" scene from the bar and the "i can't learn anything from you that i couldn't read in some fuckin' book" scene from the park bench are esentially the same which i think is interesting. i really like the whole park bench scene, i could probably quote the entire thing and i think that whole monologue is so well written especially with it being the first time in the movie will shuts up.  also the monologue that chuckie gives about "if you're still here in twenty years..." is excellent and i think that chuckie is the true unsung hero of the movie, just wanting the best for will this whole time.

        <b><u>dead poets society</u> &ensp; ★★★★★</b>
        <br>
        this one was a tragedy, like all of the other movies that are listed here. i did watch it in november, but it was over a year ago.  westy showed us part of it in spanish actually.  it has the guy that played osric in hamlet which i thought was cool.  the homo-erotic undertones were defintely there but i guess that can be said for any all male boarding school in the 50s or whenever this takes place. "science, engineering, medicine, these are all noble pursiuts, but art and poetry are what we stay alive for".  i like the stem slander. i think it's deserved.

        <b><u>saving private ryan</u> &ensp; ★★☆☆☆</b>
        <br>
        this movie absolutely is awful.  it is a glamorization of war, perhaps even worse armed forces propaganda than those tom cruise movies.  no one should be forced to watch this, it's complete nonsense and i don't know how we're supposed to take private ryan sreiously when he's played by forrest gump.  everyone knows that forrest gump fought in vietnam, not world war ii.  what kind of riverdale nonsense is this.  please fix this error.

        <b><u>breakfast at tiffany's</u> &ensp; ★★★★☆</b>
        <br>
        i watched this movie because i was dating someone in a book club, and this was the first book that we had to read.  i thought that it was going to be easy, but boy, was i wrong.  i couln't get through the first ten pages!  so i went down to the local blockbuster video to rent the movie, but it was already taken.  luckily, i got the address of the person who had it, and went down to their apparment to watch the movie with him and his teenage daughter.  however, i only got through half of the movie, as they kicked me out after i spilled wine on their couch. that is why it only gets two stars.

        <br>
        i love this movie, it's definetly one of my favorites.  not much really needs to be said since it's one of the most famous movies of all time, but perhaps my favorite scene for the past six years or so has been the one on the stairs.  that's a good one.

        <b><u>armageddon</u> &ensp; ★★★★☆</b>
        <br>
        i must admit, this one was a bit boring at first, but it eventually grew on me.  normally i don't like sci-fi space movies, but this one was pretty good.  i liked the fun outfits and all of the drama and the way that the music made the drama seem more dramatic.  the ending is very sad but in good movies, they usually are. i would give it 4.5 stars but unfortunately we are on an int-only system here.
