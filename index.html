    here is my website.  it is loosly based off of mike hueben's blog (my dream is to become a blogger). i don't care if you don't like it.  yes, i know a strawberry is a tropical fruit!  you are probably here from my finsta since that has so many followers.  it's not easy being so famous, but somehow i get by.
    <br><br>
    if you have any complaints you can email them to atjarkse@purdue.edu.  if you are here on your phone please stop and go on your laptop because i do not know how to html/css for phones and i don't intend on learning any time soon.  here is a quote from the things they carried, by tim o'brien:
    <br><br>
    "they carried the land itself— vietnam, the place, the soil— a powdery orange-red dust that covered their boots and fatigues and faces. they carried the sky. the whole atmosphere, they carried it, the  humidity, the monsoons, the stink of fungus and decay, all of it, they carried gravity."

        here i will tell you about my recipes.. there are the dun-dun noodles, which is stole from my ecuadorian mistress. my favorite food is eggs, but only the kind that i made in seventh grade.  seventh grade rachel doesn't exist anymore (all the bright and precious things fade so fast, and they don't come back) so unfortunatly my favorite food has been discontinued.  however, i think someday if i have a daughter, i will be able to eat the seventh grader eggs again.

    the great gatsby controversy
    </div>
    <div class="blog">
        there have been some rumors that i am the author of award-winning novel <i>the great gatsby</i>.  i am here to tell you that those rumors are not true.  i am only eighteen years old, and therefore was not alive in the twenties when this book was written. please, do not be alarmed at this revealation.  the real author is francis scott key fitzgerald, and i think the world should finally know this.  he, although an underground author, deserves credit for his work and i will not stand for this  theft any longer.
