# states

this is my guess the states game!!! my real passion is guessing the countries, and every morning when i wake up i go to the country guessing game and guess all 196 of them.  i wanted to make my own yassified version in javascript, but there are 75% less states than there are countries, so i figured that i would do this first.  perhaps one day i will make a country guessing game! that would require 196 unique hex/rgb codes.  good thing there's 16.5 million!!!!

andrew wehmeyer told me to have a separate image with colors and then analyze that to figure out which state (since each one of a different color) i need to fill in, and then fill it in on the blank white map.  unlike watson and crick, i like to give credit where it is due, and in this case it is due to andy.  it was very clever and now i know what a scale vector graphic is.  i love it!!!!

holden time!

“the thing is, it's really hard to be roommates with people if your suitcases are much better than theirs--if yours are really good ones and theirs aren't. you think if they're intelligent and all, the other person, and have a good sense of humor, that they don't give a damn whose suitcases are better, but they do. they really do.”

this one is a miss tbh.  i think it doesn't matter what kind of suitcase someone has.  



update:
i have changed everything and no longer am using anything andy told me to do.  but his name is still mentioned because otherwise i would not have even attempted to make a guess the states game.
