        i do not like this movie. it reminds me of the 20s which was a horrible time in human history because there was no alcohol and alcapone was running rampant in the streets.

        this movie scares me, but that is okay.  there ws a certain scene with a bagel, an i have nothing against bagels. the first time i watched it, @thereal_adubs woke me up to say 'rachel, there is a bagel' (single quotes bc js hehehh).  the second time, i was already awake. the daughter seemed a bit insane but that is how it happens sometimes. i have nothing against crazy people.

        <b><u>saving private ryan</u> &ensp; ★★☆☆☆</b>
        <br>
        this movie absolutely is awful.  it is a glamorization of war, perhaps even worse armed forces propaganda than those tom cruise movies.  no one should be forced to watch this, it's complete nonsense and i don't know how we're supposed to take private ryan sreiously when he's played by forrest gump.  everyone knows that forrest gump fought in vietnam, not world war ii.  what kind of riverdale nonsense is this.  please fix this error.

        i watched this movie because i was dating someone in a book club, and this was the first book that we had to read.  i thought that it was going to be easy, but boy, was i wrong.  i couln't get through the first ten pages!  so i went down to the local blockbuster video to rent the movie, but it was already taken.  luckily, i got the address of the person who had it, and went down to their apparment to watch the movie with him and his teenage daughter.  however, i only got through half of the movie, as they kicked me out after i spilled wine on their couch. that is why it only gets two stars.
