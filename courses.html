        <div class="movieTitle"><u>math 223: calculus iii</u></div>
        <br>
        calc iii was boring, and it was pretty tragic that i had to wake up so early for it when i never paid any attention.  we were told what was going to be on the tests, and it was only four questions, meaning that everyone got 100s.  homework was not as good, but that's okay.  there isn't much to say here.  i didn't learn calc iii the first time that i took it, and i didn't learn it the second time.  just barely enough to do okay on the tests and whatnot.  that's good enough for me though, it's not like i'm a math major or anything.

        <div class="movieTitle"><u>math 302: discrete mathematics</u></div>
        <br>
        this class was probably my favorite until the final.  it was so fun doing the homework, and even though there was so much of it, i learned a lot during each problem set and it was all very relevant to the course and the tests.  both midterms were fine, nothing interesting but also nothing awful.  the lectures were boring, but the room was at least nice.  it was in rockefeller with chalkboards and the likes.  80 extra people were let into the class, meaning that even though the room was half-full most of the time, test days were insane and there was no room to move at all.  the final was pretty bad.  maybe it was because it was 8am and i felt like i was on an airplane doing airplane puzzles, but there were a lot of conceptul questions that weren't on the homework.  the TAs were apparently in a bad mood grading the final because people were caught cheating (programing their calculators), so the results were awful.  but at least i got thirteen points back during office hours.

        <br>
        i liked the class!!! i did homework and coffee every sunday with my friend allison, it was called "physics madness".  the problem sets were fun to do, and nothing was that hard, it was al doable if you spend 2-3 hours a week on it.  the tests were also doable, there was a nice curve on all of them making around an 80 an A.  in most physics classes there isn't enough time to take the tests, but these ones were chill, just three free response questions in an hour.  the final had six free response questions in three hours, it was more than enough time.  overall, the class was much easier than ap physics c with matt lowry.  corbin covault posts lots of resources on his canvas page, and although they're around forty pages long when they could be ten (the first ten pages are always "how to take a test" and the likes), they are helpful if you actually bother to read them.

        <br>
        this class was so fun!!!! certain parts were awful but it was probably the most memorable class i've taken so far.  the midterms are hard and require a lot of studying, but after you do that studying you're set.  it got kind of fun after a bit, and i liked learning assembly.  everything was doable in the class, even the assembly, although there was definetly a learning curve trying to figure out the ports and whatnot.  the only awful part was the verilog, which is a programming language (and the software) that presumably hasn't been updated since the 90s and acts as such.  it's not on any exams or anything, just the homework.  if you so choose, the final can be 50% of your grade (dropping a midterm), which is nice because the final has 20 points of extra credit on it.

        <div class="movieTitle"><u>sages: global shakespeares</u></div>
        <br>
        there were only seven people in global shakespares, but it ended up being nice.  we read twelfth night, macbeth, and othello, and they were all decent.  it has absolutely nothing on ap lit, or any high school english class for that matter, but that's probably because there were far less people, and the books were from the 1600s instead of the 1990s, and the discussions took place at an engineering school amongst people that didn't read the required reading.  we watched a few movies that weren't in english, but that's okay, it was a nice time for me to draw my trees on scraps of paper that i found in my pocket.

        <div class="movieTitle"><u>math 122: calculus ii</u></div>
        <br>
        chris is god tier.  there is no way that this is the same calc ii that i learned sophomore year of high school because this was fine and the high school math not so much.  pretty much anyone who does what is asked of them can get an A in this class, he makes it very clear what is expected and releases the past decade of previous tests which are basically the same each year.  it's a very systematic class which is good for an intro level calc class with 200+ people.

        <div class="movieTitle"><u>engr 145: chemistry of materials</u></div>
        <br>
        this class was a joke.  i showed up to all of the lectures and did other stuff on my laptop.  i do not know any of the material that we were supposed to learn.  on the first and third test, i got a 99%, because they were open internet.  the second test was also open internet but a different story, i didn't do too hot.  and the final, which was a video presentation, never got graded, meaning that i somehow skated by with a 90 in the class despite not learning a single thing.  W class, but not if you actually intend on being an engineer.  
        <br><br><br>
        <div class="movieTitle"><u>csds 233: data structures</u></div>
        <br>
        this class was so fun!!! the entire thing is made up of six programming assignments, the midterm, and the final.  the programming assignment were so much fun, i did them all the second that they were assigned which is a bit embarassing to admit but no one goes on this website anyways.  it was just writing each data strucutre, which is pretty standard for a data structures class.  sorting kinda tripped me up but that's okay, not everyone is good at sorting.  the lectures were not really worth going to, especially the first quarter where it was just queues and stacks (how many ways are there to say that a queue is a deck of cards and a stack is a line of students?!).  we got a 8.5x11 cheat sheat on the midterm, and two of those on the final, but they weren't really necessary.  definetly a good class.

        <div class="movieTitle"><u>sages: women and leadership</u></div>
        <br>
        i have no complaints for this class.  the first, fourth, and fifth essays are graded on completion (although they are a lower percentage of the grade overall), so even though i did really badly on the second one, i still managed to do well in the class.  it was defintely pretty chill, we had reading due each class that i never completed, but i still got all my participation points by adding on to what other people were saying.  highly recommend if you want an easy sages class.
